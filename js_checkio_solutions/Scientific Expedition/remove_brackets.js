#!/usr/bin/env checkio --domain=js run remove-brackets

// Before solving this mission, you can try to solve the"Brackets"mission.
// 
// Your task is to restore the balance of open and closed brackets by removing the unnecessary ones,     while trying to use the minimum number of deletions.
// 
// Only 3 types of brackets (), [] and {} can be used in the given string.
// 
// Only a parenthesis can close a parenthesis. That is, in this expression "(}" - the brackets aren’t balanced.     In an empty string, i.e., in a string that doesn’t contain any brackets - the brackets are balanced,     but removing all of the brackets isn’t considered to be an optimal solution.
// 
// If there are more than one correct answer,     then you should choose the one where the character that can be removed is closer to the beginning.     For example, in this case  "[(])",  the correct answer will be "()",     since the removable brackets are closer to the beginning of the line.
// 
// Input:A string of characters () {} []
// 
// Output:A string of characters () {} []
// 
//

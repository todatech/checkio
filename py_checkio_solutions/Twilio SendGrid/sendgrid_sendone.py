# It all starts with your first email. Let’s try to send one.
# 
# Your mission is to create a function that sends a welcome email to a user. The function gets two arguments: email and the name of the user.
# 
# Subject of the email should be "Welcome" and body simply "Hi {name}" ({name} should be replaced by a user's name)
# 
# Input:Two arguments: email and a username.
# 
# Output:None. You should send an email. You don’t need to return anything.

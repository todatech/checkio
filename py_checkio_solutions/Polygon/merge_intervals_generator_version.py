# You are given a sequence of intervals, as tuples of ints where the tuples are sorted by  their first element in ascending order.
# Your task is to minimize the number of intervals by merging those that intersect or  by removing  those that are a part of other intervals.
# In this mission you should use 'yield' to make your function a generator.
# 
# Since the range of values for the intervals is restricted to integers, you must also  merge those intervals between which no value can be found.
# 
# An example:
# Let's say you've got these 5 intervals:1..6, 3..5, 7..10, 9..12 and 14..16.1..6 and 3..5
# 3..5fits into1..6, so3..5must disappear.1..6 and 7..10
# Even though the intervals don’t intersect, there isn’t an int type value between them, so they have to be merged with the new interval1..10.1..10 and 9..12
# These intervals do intersect, because9 < 10,      so they have to be merged with the new interval1..12.1..12 and 14..16
# These two intervals don’t intersect, so they mustn’t be merged.So the intervals to be returned are:
# 1..12 and 14..16
# 
# Input:A sequence of intervals as a  list of tuples of 2 ints, sorted by their first element.
# 
# Output:The merged intervals as a list of tuples of 2 ints, sorted by their first element.

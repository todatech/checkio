# As the input you will get the chemical formula and the number N. Your task is to create a list of the chemical elements, which are in the formula in the amount of >= N.
# Pay attention, that in the some formulas will be used brackets - () and [].This articlewill help you to open the brackets and don't make mistake while counting.

# Input:Chemical formula and the number of atoms.
# 
# Output:List of the chemical elements, sorted in the alphabetical order.

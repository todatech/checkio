# Sophie has found a stash books and she wants to find information about the ancients who lived on the islands.    Unfortunately, she does not have a text search module and needs some help.    Let's write a program to help her search for keywords on the pages of a book.
# 
# You are given some plain text (without tags) and a string with keywords (or parts of words, or letters) separated by spaces.    You will need to find all the keywords and put these words into "<span></span>" wrappers to highlight them for Sophie.    You can ignore upper or lower cases for the key words, but the original letter cases in the text should remain.
# 
# For the cases when keywords contain or intersect each other you should highlight the larger word without nested span tags.    Let's look it with example.
# The text"Hello World! Or LOL"and keywords"hell world or lo".
# The word"World"contains two keywords thus we tag only larger part"<span>World</span>".
# "Hello"contains two intersected words"hell"and"lo"and we tag the larger part again"<span>Hello</span>".
# Be careful, a result like"<span>Hel<span>lo</span></span>"is considered wrong because it contains nested tags.
# 
# Input:Two arguments. A text and key words as strings.
# 
# Output:The text with wrapped key words.
# 
# Precondition:
# 0 < len(text) < 5000
# 0 < len(the_number_of_key_words) < 30
#

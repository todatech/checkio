# This mission is the advanced version of the 'Identify Block' mission.
# 
# You have to write a code to check the development of drawing a dice.
# 
# The input represents the development of drawing one dice.It's a list of strings.These strings are of the same length. They consist of 1 to 6 digits and a space. These digits represent each side of the dice.
# 
# If the development is correct, return True.If the followng cases, return False:You can't complete a cube.The sum of the top and bottom sides doesn't always equals 7.11 nets of a cube.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:A list of strings.
# 
# Output:The answer as a boolean.
# 
# 
# 
# Precondition:
# all(len(row) == len(paper[0]) for row in paper)all((cell in '123456 ' for cell in row) for row in paper)
# 
# 
# END_DESC

# Your task is to swap elements of the list (Iterable) pairwise. If you are given a list of 4 elements, then your function should return the same list, only in it the first and second elements are interchanged, as well as the third and fourth.
# 
# If there isnâ€™t a paired amount of elements, then leave the last unpaired element in its place. An empty list should remain empty.
# 
# Input:Iterable.

# Output:Iterable.

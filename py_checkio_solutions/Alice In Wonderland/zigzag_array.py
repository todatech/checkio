#!/usr/bin/env checkio --domain=py run zigzag-array

# This function creates an List of lists. that represents a two-dimensional grid with the given number of rows and  cols. This grid should contain the integers fromstarttostart + rows * cols - 1in ascending order, but the elements of every odd-numbered row have to be listed in descending order, so that when read in ascending order, the numbers zigzag through the two-dimensional grid.
# 
# Input:Two ints rows and cols. One optional argument start.
# 
# Output:List of lists.

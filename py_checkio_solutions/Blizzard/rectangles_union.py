# Your mission is to calculate the area covered by a union of rectangles. The rectangles can have a non-empty intersection, which means that a simple sum of given rectangle areas doesn't work. Every rectangle is represented as 4 integers. The first two integers are the coordinates of a left-top corner, and the next two - of a bottom right corner.

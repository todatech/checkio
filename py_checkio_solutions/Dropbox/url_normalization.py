#!/usr/bin/env checkio --domain=py run url-normalization

# URL normalization is the process by which URLs are modified and standardized in a    consistent manner. The goal of the normalization process is to transform a URL into a normalized or canonical URL so    it is possible to determine if two syntactically different URLs may be equivalent.
# 
# For our normalization we will use normalizations that preserve semantics.    You should normalize a given url using the next rules (only these rules. They are slightly different from RFC).
# 
# Normalization Rules:1. Converting the scheme and host to lower case.HTTP://www.Example.com/ → http://www.example.com/2. Capitalizing letters in escape sequences.        All letters within a percent-encoding triplet (e.g., "%3B") are case-insensitive, and should be capitalized.http://www.example.com/a%c2%b1b → http://www.example.com/a%C2%B1b3. Decoding percent-encoded octets of unreserved characters. For consistency, percent-encoded octets in the        ranges        ofALPHA (%41–%5A and %61–%7A), DIGIT (%30–%39), hyphen (%2D), period (%2E), underscore (%5F), or tilde        (%7E)should not be created by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) producers and, when found in a URI, should be decoded to their corresponding        unreserved characters by URI normalizers.http://www.example.com/%7Eusername/ → http://www.example.com/~username/4. Removing the default port. The default port (port 80 for the “http” scheme) should be removed from a URL.http://www.example.com:80/bar.html → http://www.example.com/bar.html5. Removing dot-segments. The segments “..” and “.” can be removed from a URL according to the algorithm        described in RFC 3986 (or a similar algorithm). ".." is a parent directory, "." is the same directory.http://www.example.com/a/b/../c/./d.html → http://www.example.com/a/c/d.htmlAdditional links:If you are interested to know more about URL normalization    (This is not necessarily for this task), then you can find more information here:Wikipedia,RFC3986
